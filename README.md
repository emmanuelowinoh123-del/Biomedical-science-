📘 Project Overview

This project investigates the presence, diversity, and antibiotic resistance profiles of microorganisms isolated from high-contact surfaces within public environments. The study was conducted to assess the microbial contamination burden and evaluate the susceptibility patterns of common bacterial isolates to guide hygiene interventions and antimicrobial stewardship.


---

🎯 Objectives

1. To isolate and identify bacteria from frequently touched public surfaces.


2. To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolated organisms.


3. To analyze and interpret microbial distribution and resistance trends statistically.


4. To provide recommendations for improved hygiene practices and infection control.

🧪 Methodology

Sample Collection:

Samples were swabbed from door handles, desks, washroom taps, phones, and laboratory benches in high-traffic areas.


Laboratory Procedures:

1. Culturing on Nutrient Agar, MacConkey Agar, and Mannitol Salt Agar.


2. Microscopic examination and Gram staining for bacterial differentiation.


3. Biochemical tests for microbial identification (Catalase, Coagulase, TSI, Citrate, Urease, Indole).


4. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method following CLSI guidelines.



Antibiotics Tested:
Ampicillin, Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin, Cotrimoxazole, Erythromycin, and Tetracycline.

Data Analysis:

Data were entered and analyzed in R/Python for descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, and visualization of resistance trends.

🧫 Key Findings

Staphylococcus spp., Bacillus spp., E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Proteus spp. were the most frequently isolated organisms.

Antibiotic resistance was most pronounced in Ampicillin and Cotrimoxazole, while Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin showed higher sensitivity.

The study highlighted the potential of high-contact surfaces as reservoirs for resistant pathogens, underscoring the need for regular disinfection and public awareness.
